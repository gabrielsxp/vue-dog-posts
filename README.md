This is my very first application created with Vue Js.
I used the [N161Tech Public API](https://n161.tech/t/dummyapi/) to get dummy data and used axios to consume the API.
As a first step I learned a lot
- How to import and register componentes (global and locally)
- Life-cycle methods
- Differences between methods and computed
- Data binding with mustache syntax
- Attributes Definition on template (v:bind, v:on, etc)
- Use of directives
- How to pass data from HOC to LOC
- Local Scope Styling
- API consumption
- Register Events
- How to use a Event Bus to share data with multiple components
- Definition of custom event
- Use of watchers to handle async code
